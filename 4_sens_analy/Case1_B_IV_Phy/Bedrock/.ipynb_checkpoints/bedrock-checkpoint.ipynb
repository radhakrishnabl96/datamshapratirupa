    "- Expected results: Since we are not considering the precipitation input at the top, we might not observe significant changes with respect to the Physical properties. However, during the thawing season there is a release of water due to which the change in the parameters might significantly affect the results in the upper layers [Peat and mineral layer]. The changes might be as follows:\n",
    "    - Porosity : Effects on water flow - As the porosity increases, the water flow within the system will also increase (including moisture), heat advection rate will also increase in the system, however it won't majorly affect a 1-D column (Probably during the thawing season it might have an influence). Effects on heat flow - As the porosity increases, the VWC (can be ice, gas, liquid) also increases. The thermal capacity of the soil medium will decrease, as thermal capacity of liquid < thermal capacity of solids. Therefore, the transfer of heat is reduced which might result in lower temperatures. **Porosity ↑ --> s_w ↑ --> T ↓**     \n",
    "    - Compressible porosity: Is this the porosity which might change the compressibility of the soil medium? Normally applicable for confined aquifers? Based on this assumption, it might not make a significant impact on the results.   \n",
    "    - Permeability - Effects on water flow - As the permeability increases, the water flow within the medium will also increase because the darcy velocity is affected. Therefore, we will be expecting more moisture movement. The darcy velocity also increases the thermal advection rate within the medium - which might result in greater temperatures during the summer [when ice thaws]. **Permeability ↑ --> s_w ↑ (hard to say) --> T ↑ (During summer - when T_soil > 0°C)**\n",
    "    - Soil density: As the soil density increases, the thermal capacity of the soil also increases. This will lead to greater temperatures within the soil column. It's effects on soil moisture is hard to say, it might decreases as density increases. **Soil density ↑ --> s_w ↓ (might decrease) --> T ↑**\n",
