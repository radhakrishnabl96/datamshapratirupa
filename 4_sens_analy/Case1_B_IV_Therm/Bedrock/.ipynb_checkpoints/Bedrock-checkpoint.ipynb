    "- Expected results: The thermal parameters will mainly influence the subsurface temperature results. Porosity also influences the thermal parameters in the frozen or transition state. As porosity increases, the tc of the medium also increases. Regarding the influence of moisture, as the tc of the medium increases, the soil will undergo thaw at a faster rate, due to which the moisture will be released and an increase is expected. The changes w.r.t each parameter might be as follows:\n",
