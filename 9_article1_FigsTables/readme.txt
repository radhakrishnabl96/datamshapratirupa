We checked if the following figure is suitable for color blind people through the link - https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/. It was not suitable mainly for people suffering from Monochromacy. Especially when we have two plots, such as in the second figure. Therefore, we are using a dashed line.
All figures with ending '_c' is color blind proof.
