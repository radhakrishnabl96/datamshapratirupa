The template directory contains all the modflow6 and pest++ v5 files needed to implement the workflow demonstrated in "Approaches to Highly Parameterized Inversion: PEST++ Version 5, a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis" report by White and others (2020).  The control files are named for the tools that were applied (e.g. "freyberg6_run_ies.pst", "freyberg6_run_opt.pst", etc). To implement the "basic" and "advanced" runs for pestpp-glm and pestpp-ies, users need to change the optional pest++ arguments added to the respective control files to be consistent with the options listed in the report.
